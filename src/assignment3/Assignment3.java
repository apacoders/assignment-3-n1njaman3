 * REQUIREMENT 1:
 * 
 * Create an ArrayList that contains a list of all animals defined in this program (see Animal class)

 * (c) walkTo(0, 1)
 * (d) whereAmI()
 * 
 * See the Animal class for further details
 *

 * It must call the protected constructor on the Animal and set:
 * 
 * legs to 4 and soundParameter to Meow
 *

 * legs to 4 and soundParameter to Woof
 * 
 * MOUSE CLASS REQUIREMENTS
